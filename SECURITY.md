If you find a vulnerability, please reach out:
- Email: security@boomai.dev
- Or open a private GitHub Security Advisory (preferred for sensitive issues).

Include:
- What’s the issue and impact?
- Steps to reproduce and affected configs?

I’ll acknowledge within 3 business days and share a plan or status update within 10 business days. Please keep it private until there’s a fix.
