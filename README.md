# Boomai

Boomai is local-first AI orchestration for your models, data, and tools.
It runs on your machine, connects to local or API LLMs, indexes your workspace,
and exposes everything through an extensible assistant interface and pluggable mods.

## Status

Early work in progress. Expect things to change and break.

## Repo structure

- `core/` – core daemon (models, RAG, mod runtime)
- `desktop/` – desktop app (UI shell)
- `mods/` – built-in/example mods
- `docs/` – docs and design notes
